# XMLParser
A tool to read the XML sheet provided in a Captivate export, and turn it into usable text.

#Contributions
Please contribute if you find this useful. I'm still a novice, and getting my head around git, but I'll do my best.

#Executable
If you just want to use this tool, just download the .exe file found in the release folder.
This is an unsigned exe, so you will have to allow it to run if you computer has Windows Smart Screen active.
This is completely safe, if you don't believe me, the source is there.
