# XMLParser
A tool to read the XML sheet provided in a Captivate export, and turn it into usable text.

###Description
Turn your slide note captions from this:
![Slide notes](https://github.com/RandyMustache/RandyMustache.github.io/blob/master/_images/tts.PNG?raw=true)

to this:

![xmlparsed](https://github.com/RandyMustache/RandyMustache.github.io/blob/master/_images/2017-02-23.png?raw=true)

Just export your slide notes to XML in Captivate, then open them in this program, click display text and you'll have usable text to work with.

Notes on a new slide will appear as a new line breaked paragraph in the application. Visually dividing each slide.

###Contributions
Please contribute if you find this useful. I'm still a novice, and getting my head around git, but I'll do my best.

###Executable
If you just want to use this tool, just download the .exe file found in the release folder.
This is an unsigned exe, so you will have to allow it to run if you computer has Windows Smart Screen active.
This is completely safe, if you don't believe me, the source is there.
